# REDRES User Manual

## Introduction

REDRES is a visualization software for molecular dynamics simulations with a focus on analyzing and validating event detection data.
The software is specifically tailored to be used in combination with [TOFHET](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/modes/tofhed).
REDRES allows you to import SQL databases to view and edit the event data generated by TOFHET. Alternatively, the software includes
the functionality to convert your .xyz and .extxyz files to a SQL database to be used as input.
