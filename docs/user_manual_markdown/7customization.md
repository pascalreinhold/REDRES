# Customization

You can adjust the appearance of the simulation results as well as the [camera movement behavior](#camera-movement-behavior).
The most important options are easily accessible in the [View](#view) dropdown menu in the top left corner.

## View

In the *view* dropdown menu in the top left corner,
for each kind of element in your simulation (atoms, bonds, vector arrows etc.),
you'll find a checkbox to toggle, whether to render them at all, and a slider to determine their size.

## User Preferences Window

You can access the *User Preferences* Window by clicking on `File > User Preferences`
in the top left corner.

### Color Theme

In the *Color Theme* section
you can toggle light/dark mode by clicking the `Toggle to Light/Dark Mode` button.
Beneath that, there is the option to customize the editors base colors, either by entering an RGB-value or by
using the color picker.

### Camera Movement Behavior

In the *Camera and Movement* section
you can customize the camera's movement behavior as well as it's optical parameters via a collection of text fields.

### Rendering Parameters

The Sliders in the *Rendering Parameters* section correspond to the settings in the [View](#view) dropdown.

## Material Parameters

The `Tool Windows > Material Parameter Window` allows you to adjust the appearance of your simulation results
by component (atoms, bonds, vector arrows etc.)
via a collection of sliders. They represent how light in the scene interacts with each object type.
