# Installation

For now the software is only available for Linux.
If you run a Debian based distribution like Ubuntu you can just grab the
.deb-package from the packages directory and install via your package manager,
by running something like:
```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install /filepath_to_package/packe_name.deb
```
If you are using a different distribution
or want to build from source for other reasons read the [Build Instructions](3build.md#build-instructions).
