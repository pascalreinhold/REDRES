TODO:
    -> Swapchain Validation Error Message on resize

DONE:
    -> Possibility to start with no db and have a db hot loaded
    -> Create a way to control movie frame rate
    ->Implement Mouse Input
    ->Integrate DearImGui
    ->Make DrawCallBuffer GPUOnly
    ->Make the Window-Resizable
    -> Camera Z-Coord has the wrong sign
    -> BUG: If reactant and catalyst are in different cells due to mic the cylinder is currently placed in the middle
    -> BUG: MIC for non-orthorhombic Cells are not working correctly (Not sure if forget to transpose the unit cell matrix)
    -> Unmapping of Device Memory should not be performed if the memory has to be remapped every frame
    -> Create BufferAbstraction and check if less remapping improves performance



Unnecessary:
    -> Check if specialization consts are available for compute pipelines
        -> if yes handle y invocation size with it
    -> Clean Up UBO-Buffer with the scene data
