Atom Base Types:
1.Added buttons to toggle coloring atoms by element or by atom base type
    ->Color for base types is can be set in the preferences and is saved across sessions
2.Function to negate the selected by area tag
3.Function to update the tags of all atoms in an experiment of a certain property_id to a specified value in the database
  ->Added two buttons to tag selected atoms as either catalyst or chemical and immediately update the database via an SQL transaction (seems quite fast (: )
4.Clamped the zoom for the isometric view so that you can not invert the view by zooming in too far
5.Remove Atom Selection on pressing Escape

Misc:
7.The Window Title Bar now displays the filepath of the current database
8.Unit Cell is now read from the new SQL parameters is the system table
