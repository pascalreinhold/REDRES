SQL
1. Fixed the memory leaks in visDataLoader, as I did not know that every sqlite3_prepare_v2() call
 must be followed by sqlite3_finalize() call and forget to close the database connection.
2. Database connection is now in read-only mode. When a function needs to write to the database, it disconnects
 from the database, opens a new connection in read-write mode, performs the write operation, and then
 reconnects to the database in read-only mode (this seems to speed up the database SELECT queries).

3. Added two buttons to the tool bar, that they pressed. The State of the button corresponds to the ui-mode,
 that is either "select" or "measure". The "measure" mode is the default mode.
